## Introduction

I used 'PLIER' package(with default settings) to construct factors related to Canonical Pathways here. 

## Results

### Overview

    - I used 12,491 gene in DGN data set to construct factors. 5568 of them were used in PLIER.
    - I used CanonicalPathways in PLIER R package, which contains 545 curated pathways from Reactome and KEGG.
    - I obtained 110 LVs from PLIER, 25 of them have AUC > 0.70(see figure below).



### LVs with AUC>0.70

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=T}
plotU(plierResult, auc.cutoff = 0.7, fdr.cutoff = 0.05, top =3) 
```
