Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis_DGN/tree/349226924ead5e5bdb3a98fbff48098b930f93cb" target="_blank">3492269</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I split the DGN data into two halves, and use one half to train the expression model, and the other half to assess association with factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Weights training</li>
</ol>
<p>Split the DGN samples(922) into two equal part (part1-training part, part2). Employ FUSION to train weights on part1, models: LASSO, Elastic-net, BLUP</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cis-gene imputation</li>
</ol>
<p>Use weights in step1 to impute the cis genetic component part of gene expression. For both part1 and part2, we imputed cis-genes and named these cis-genes as cis-gene-part1 and cis-gene-part2.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Association test:</li>
</ol>
<p>LVs ~ cis-gene-part1</p>

<p>Record the p-values for each gene.</p>
<p>4.Count the number of significant associations at various p-value threshold for each LV.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>12,398 of 12,491 genes have cis-snps.</p></li>
<li><p>I got 5629 weights from lasso model, 1428 from elastic-net model, 5635 weights from blup models.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The tables below show the number of significant associations at various p-value threshold for each LV. The first column is the pearson corralation index. The suffix ’_s’ means impute gene expression using the same part samples and the suffix ’_d’ means impute gene expression using different part samples.</p>
<p>I also made a histogram to show the distribution of the numbers.</p>
